7. You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. 
The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. 
Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. 
Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.


9. Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. 
As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. 
(Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). 
For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.



10. Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), 
the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. 
The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. 
For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.

11. Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row. 
For a visual reference of this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below.



13 Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. 
Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). 
Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of 
the browser window. 
Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. 
Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section 
title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as 
  discussed in Lecture 19.)

14 Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to 
some color (of your choosing). Set the background color of each section title region to 
some unique color (of your choosing). Make sure that the background color still allows the 
user to view the text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the color you 
choose, you may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black 
border on both the section and section title region that is 1px thick. Warning: While not 
specifying borders and colors according to the requirements does not hurt your grade so much, 
not doing so will make it much harder for your classmates to peer grade the rest of your 
assignment, possibly resulting in a much lower grade.

15 (OPTIONAL) You will NOT be graded on this, but you may want to explicitly 
set a font-family for the text in your page, so you are not stuck with the default 
browser font family. Also, set the font size of the heading and section title to be 75% 
larger and 25% larger (respectively) than the font size of the dummy text.
